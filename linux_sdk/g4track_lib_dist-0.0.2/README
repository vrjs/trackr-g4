Instructions on how to install the G4Track library.

The Polhemus G4Track library is required to interface with the Polhemus G4 Tracker.  This library is available as a static or shared library in binary form only.  The G4Track library is proprietary software and no source code is provided.

The G4Track library utilizes the libusb-1.0 library.  This is available for download online.

To install the G4Track libraries:

1.  Copy g4track_dist-x.x.x.tar.gz to a directory of your choice.  Unzip with 'tar -xvzf g4track_dist-x.x.x.tar.gz'.

2.  cd to the directory where the G4Track files were just extracted (g4track_dist-x.x.x).

3.  run ./configure; then 'make install sysconfdir=/etc'.  You will need root authority to run 'make install'.  This will install the libraries on your system (eg. /usr/local/lib) as well as installing the man pages for G4, and installing the necessary udev rules file (/etc/udev/rules.d/90-Polhemus_trkr_01.rules) for usb operations.

4. It may be necessary to run ldconfig on /usr/local/lib after the installation.  See man 8 ldconfig.

5.  To uninstall G4Track run 'make uninstall sysconfdir=/etc'.  You will need root authority to run 'make uninstall'.

6.  If the libraries fail to install you can manually copy the libraries from the g4track_dist.x.x.x/bin/.xlibs directory to the system library directory.
